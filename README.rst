wunderpy

|Build Status| |Version| |Downloads|

This here is a Wunderlist API wrapper for python. It was originally the only
publicly available client for their API, and somehow became popular...

You can read the documentation at `readthedocs.`_

Disclaimer
----------

In no way is this project near complete or perfect. There are a lot of
things that can be done better, especially design-wise, that I'm trying
to fix as I learn more. Things are liable to change or break
unexpectedly.

Example
-------

::

    from datetime import datetime
    from wunderpy import Wunderlist

    w = Wunderlist()
    w.login("username", "password")
    w.update_lists()  # you have to run this first, before you do anything else

    w.add_list("test")  # make a new list called "test"

    due = datetime.now().isoformat()
    w.add_task("test wunderpy", list_title="test", note="a note",
               due_date=due, starred=True)  # add a task to it
    w.complete_task("test wunderpy", "test")  # complete it
    w.delete_task("test wunderpy", "test")  # and delete it

    w.delete_list("test")  # and delete the list

Building the Docs
-----------------

To generate the documentation:

::

    cd docs
    make html # other options are available
    # look in the docs/build/html dir for the documentation

Running Tests
-------------

I'm working on writing tests for everything.

If you want to run said tests, make sure you have nose installed. Once you have nose, all you have to do is run nosetests.

By default, nose will not run any tests for the API calls, as they take around 30 seconds. If you want to run those tests, you can either store your email and password in
the WUNDERPY_EMAIL and WUNDERPY_PASSWORD env_vars, or you can install nose-testconfig and create an ini file like this:

::

    [login]
    email = test@email.web
    password = password

Then you can run nosetests with the --tc-file argument.

Contributing
------------

First off, I can't thank you enough. This is my first open source project that receives even a small amount of attention, so I'm a bit new to all of this. I don't have many guidelines, just make sure your code passes PEP8, and try to have pull requests merge to the develop branch. I like to follow something akin to the `gitflow`_ branching model, so merging to develop makes that a lot easier.
